# M2sys
It's am assignment project. The target which we want to achieve from this project is:
- Fetch data from a given api and generate a search suggestion.
- Persist json data and present from local.
- Try to implement it in MVVM pattern.

# Discussion and future improvement:
As it's a dummy project. We do not make different framework or package for independent module. We can improve this part.

# N.B: The existing code is moduler and indipendent but not seperated into framework or packages
